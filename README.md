## Description:
Cheesyrat is an easy tool used to generate a peristent backdoor for remote access to a Windows machine. This tool creates malware with custom coded payloads that can be then easily executed on a Windows machine. The malware that is created with this tool has a high ability to __bypass__ most present-day antivirus detection. This project is still a __work in progress__ so there is a high chance of multiple bugs.
